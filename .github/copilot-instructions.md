We use Typescript with React and Material UI for frontend.

We use Python with strict typing for backend.

When being asked about specific lines, only return the relevant code, not all the code in the file.

When writing tests for Python, always use pytest function-based tests. Fully annotate the test function.

For JSDoc:
    - Do not add empty lines in the docstring.
    - Do not add type hints in the docstring.
